# ðŸš€ Futurama

Futurama is one of my favorite tv shows, this project is a character searcher. Data is from an API that returns 15 characters. You could filter by name, specie and origin and you can also sort the list alphabetically saving data as well in your local storage. Also if you click on a character you will navigate to its own page where you will find more details and discover its most common sayings.
